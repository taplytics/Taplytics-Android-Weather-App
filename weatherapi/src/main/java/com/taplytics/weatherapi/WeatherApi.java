     * Implement WeatherApi getWeather methods here
     *

     *
     * https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=
     *
     * where query is the name of the city/place to get the weather forecast
     *
     * The API will return a "woeid" which in turn will be need to used in this subsequent api call:
     *
     * https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/{woeid}
     *
     * You can find the response example in the file metaweather_response.json. Your only concern

     *
     * "The temperature in Toronto is __°C."
     *
     * You may use any library you wish

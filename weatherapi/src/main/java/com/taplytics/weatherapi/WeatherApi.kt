  /**
   * Implement WeatherApi getWeather methods here
   *
   * You will be using this API:
   *
   * https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=
   *
   * where query is the name of the city/place to get the weather forecast
   *
   * The API will return a "woeid" which in turn will be need to used in this subsequent api call:
   *
   * https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/{woeid}
   *
   * You can find the response example in the file metaweather_response.json. Your only concern
   * will be to format the text view in MainActivity to display:
   *
   * "The temperature in Toronto is __Â°C."
   *
   * You may use any library you wish
